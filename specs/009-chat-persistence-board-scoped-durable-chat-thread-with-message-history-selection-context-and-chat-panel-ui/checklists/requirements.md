# Specification Quality Checklist: Chat Persistence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-03-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Spec makes informed assumptions about agent response mechanism (stubbed or real) and chat panel layout (panel or drawer) rather than requiring clarification, as both have reasonable defaults.
- Selection context validation rules align with existing data model (documentation/data-model.md section 6.7 and documentation/validation-rules.md chat section).
- Board lifecycle enforcement rules align with functional spec sections 14.2 and 14.3 (archived = read-only, deleted = not found).
